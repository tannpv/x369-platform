source /home/tannpv/x369-workspace/scripts/git-flow.sh
```

### **Feature Development:**
```bash
create_feature <name> [scope]     # Create new feature branch
finish_feature                    # Finish current feature
cleanup_feature <branch>          # Clean up merged branch
sync_develop                      # Sync with develop branch
```

### **Quick Operations:**
```bash
quick_commit <type> <scope> <msg>  # Conventional commit
flow_status                       # Show Git flow status
test_project <project>            # Test before commit
```

### **Release Management:**
```bash
create_release <version>          # Create release branch
finish_release                    # Finish current release
create_hotfix <name>             # Create hotfix branch
finish_hotfix <version>          # Finish current hotfix
```
