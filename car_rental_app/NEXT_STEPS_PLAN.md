## 🚀 **NEXT ACTIONS (Immediate)**

1. **📱 Test API Connection**: 
   - Open `http://localhost:3003` 
   - Navigate to Profile → Settings → API Test
   - Click "Test API Connection"

2. **🔍 Debug Issues**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Use file logging to track issues
   - Verify network requests in DevTools

3. **✅ Fix & Iterate**:
   - Address any connectivity issues
